  <p>When you start, a video will play. After it's over, 
              check your inventory to find that you have a <span class="objeto">Letter from Mary</span> and a <span class="objeto">Photo of Mary</span>. 
              If you ever examine these items, you'll have a less

 <p>Exit the washroom and another video will play. After 
              it's over, run over to the driver's side of James' 
              blue car and take the <span class="mapa">Map of Silent 
              Hill</span> on the seat. Then run west until you see 
              &quot;Toluca Lake&quot; on a sign by some stairs. The road to 
              the west is blocked so go down these stairs. Keep 
              following the path until you reach well. If you 
              examine the well, you can find a <span class="save">Save Point</span> inside it. Go through the steel gate further down.</p>

			 </br>
			 <p>Follow the path and it will diverge into a 
              graveyard. Head towards the graves and James will 
              meet a young dark-haired woman and asks for 
              directions to Silent Hill. She tells James the town 
              in dangerous but he doesn't care and that he'll go 
              anyway. From now and on, use your map to know where 
              you go. After the video is over, head to the 
              northwest gate in the corner and go through it. Now 
              follow this path for a while.</p>
			  
			   <table width="60%" border="0" class="tabla">
              <tr>
                <td><i>Extra Item</i><br />
                  After you've beaten the game at least once on the right side of the path you'll come across a <span class="arma">Chainsaw</span> (also if you're playing on Easy Combat Level).</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
			
			 <p>Further down the path you'll need to 
              go through a gate near the fenced area. Now you're 
              on Wiltse Road so continue all the way to Sanders 
              Street. When you reach Sanders Street, head to the 
              other side of the road and move east past the Flower 
              Shop. Grab the <span class="curacion"> First-Aid Kit</span> on the table run west to 
              Lindsey Street.</p>
            <p>James finds some blood streaks on the road and a 
              monster is seen in the distance on Lindsey Street. 
              If you want a <span class="curacion"> Health Drink</span>, there's one up some stairs at 
              the southwest corner of Sanders and Lindsey Street. 
              Head north on Lindsey Street on the east sidewalk 
              since Katz Street is blocked off. Get the <span class="curacion"> Health Drink</span> sitting by the garage door and continue to Vachss 
              Road, where blood streaks are seen again. There's 
              another <span class="curacion"> Health Drink</span> by another garage door on Lindsey 
              Street, past the opening of Vachss. Move east down 
              Vachss and enter the fenced area to find <span class="curacion">2 
              Health Drinks</span> and a <span class="save">Save Point</span> on a table. Exit the area and continue down Vachss 
              Road, past a gate, until you reach a construction 
              site where some weird static is heard; enter the 
              site through the wood planks.</p>
            
			<div class="sketchfab-embed-wrapper" align="center"> <iframe title="Wooden Plank" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; xr-spatial-tracking" xr-spatial-tracking execution-while-out-of-viewport execution-while-not-rendered web-share width="640" height="480" src="https://sketchfab.com/models/f721bcfe88d04ccd89560bcfece1a7e7/embed?ui_theme=dark"> </iframe> </div>
			</br>
			<p>A video will play and James finds a <span class="objeto">Radio</span> inside 
              that seems to be making the racket. Then he sees a 
              Patient Demon and takes a <span class="arma">Wooden Plank</span> from the barricade structure to 
              fight it. From now and on, use the Wooden Plank 
              until further notice. Now hold R2 and walk up to the 
              demon, and then whack it with the X button until it 
              falls down. James will confirm that the demon is 
              killed. Exit the construction site and James takes 
              out the radio, which then makes more static and a 
              voice similar to Mary's is heard; but it's not very 
              clear. Run back to Lindsey Street.</p>
            <p>There are some more Patient Demons around here so 
              just watch out. Feel free to practice your plank 
              skills and kill them. Near the Katz and Lindsey 
              Street intersection you'll find a stone monument 
              with partially readable words engraved into it. When 
              you're done here, head to Katz Street to find that 
              it's not blocked anymore.</p>
            <p>What you want to do is to get the Rosewater Park but 
              it won't be so easy. North Neely Street is blocked 
              and west Katz Street is blocked off with a locked 
              door, and there's a locked gate that leads to the 
              apartments; so expect to go back there. Your next 
              step is to try Saul Street. So head there, and if 
              you want some health, there is a <span class="curacion">Health Drink</span> past halfway down the south Martin Street/alley on 
              the east side. You'll probably encounter an annoying 
              Giant Roach and some Patient Demons by the alley 
              though. Also be sure to pick up the <span class="curacion">First Aid-Kit</span> at the east side of Happy Burger on the way to Saul.</p>
            <p>Once at Saul Street, you'll notice that it's blocked 
              off with a locked gate door, but there's a motorhome 
              very close to it; so enter it. There is a memo 
              saying &quot;I'll wait at 'BAR Neely's'&quot; on the couch, so 
              that's your next destination. There's also a <span class="save">Save Point</span> on the bed. </p>
			  
			   <table width="100%" border="0" class="tabla">
              <tr>
                <td><i>Extra Item</i><br />
                  After you've beaten the game on Normal or Hard Action Level you'll find a <span class="arma">Hyper Spray</span> inside the motorhome.</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
			
			 <p>Exit the motorhome through the 
              left door and head to Neely's Bar. Once inside, look 
              at the map on the counter and James will notice a 
              question mark at the top of Martin Street. Read the 
              strange message on the paper-covered window and exit 
              the bar. Make your way to Martin Street past some 
              Patient Demons and you'll here a Roach somewhere 
              when you get there. Move north up the street, 
              getting the <span class="curacion"> Health Drink</span> by the left fence on the way.</p>
            <p>If you want a surprise, run right beside the white 
              van. The Patient Demon will be moving on the ground 
              for a while so just ignore it and move north to find 
              a corpse where the question mark is. You can find an <span class="objeto">Apartment Gate Key</span> right by the corpse. Finally you have a key; there's 
              a locked apartment gate at west Katz Street so head 
              there.</p>
            <p>On the way, you may want to head north up Neely 
              Street for a corpse with six memos near it giving 
              you tips on the monsters. There will also be Patient 
              Demons moving on the ground there so kill them 
              before reading the memos. At the corner of Katz and 
              Neely Street, you can find a <span class="curacion">First-Aid Kit</span> and a pack of <span class="curacion"> Handgun Bullets</span>. Continue west, past some 
              enemies, until you reach the gate where the camera 
              angle changes. Go through the gate door, using the Apartment Gate Key, 
              and then enter the apartments in front of you, which 
              is called Wood Side Apartments.</p>
			  
			  <h1 id="segunda"><u>02. Wood Side Apartments</u></h1>
			  <h2><i>&quot;You too, huh. Something just brought you here, right?&quot;</i></h2>
			  
			  <p> When you enter, turn left and get the <span class="mapa">Map of the Apt 
              Bldg</span> on the bulletin board. There's a <span class="save">Save Point</span> on the wall to the right and a <span class="curacion">Health Drink</span> on the small brickwork by the stairs. The door 
              leading to the courtyard is locked so go up to 2F. 
              It's too dark here to read your map so head to the 
              right, ignoring the north hallway, and when you 
              reach the Patient Demon go through the door there, 
              which should be Room 205.</p>

			</p>
			<p>Inside you'll notice light coming from a fashion 
              dummy wearing clothes similar to Mary's. Grab the <span class="objeto">Flashlight</span> on 
              it and then a Mannequin monster will get up from 
              behind it. Kill it if you want or just exit. Head 
              back towards the stairwell, moving past a Patient 
              Demon on the way, and go through the open blue 
              doorway there. Examine the garbage shoot to find 
              some stuck garbage in the shoot. You don't have 
              anything for it now, so enter the stairwell and go 
              up to 3F.</p>
            <p>  On the other side of the gate thing here, a key is 
              seen. Try to grab it and a little girl will step on 
              James' hand and kick the key away. She'll laugh and 
              run away. Since you can't get the key now, enter the 
              only open room up here, which is Room 301 at the end 
              of the hallway. After you enter, walk up to the 
              shopping cart in the middle of the room and take the <span class="arma">Handgun</span> (make sure your 
              Flashlight is on so you can get it). Try not to use 
              the Handgun yet, even if you have ammo for it. Exit 
              the room and run back down to 2F.</p>

            </br>
			<p>Now head east and try to head north up the hallway 
              and you'll hear a muffled scream. So head north, 
              where it's coming from, and you will see a demon 
              glowing red on the other side of the gate blockade! 
              What is going on here!? Enter the close by Room 208 
              to find someone murdered sitting in a chair with the 
              TV on. Notice something shining on the shelf and 
              take the <span class="objeto">Key to Room 
              202</span>. If you go through the doorway by the 
              shelf, you'll find a clock in an empty room. You can 
              try to push it but it won't budge, so just exit the 
              room.</p>
            <p>The monster is gone now and since you have the key, 
              head to Room 202 past a Patient Demon, using the Key 
              to Room 202 to get inside. First, get the <span class="curacion">Health Drink</span> on the kitchenette counter, then enter the open 
              bedroom. Go up to the hole in the wall with green 
              liquid coming out of it. Examine the hole to get the <span class="objeto">Clock Key</span>. 
              There's a clock in Room 208 so exit the room and run 
              to Room 208 again. Go in the clock room, go up to 
              the clock and use the Clock Key on the clock face.</p>
			  
			  
			  <table width="100%" class="tabla">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><h4>Clock Puzzle</h4>
            <img src="https://www.silenthillmemories.net/sh2/walkthrough/pics/sh2_p01_03.jpg" align="left" width="400" height="300" hspace="20" vspace="20"> There are some clues in this room on how to solve this puzzle but you can just 
              read the solution at the bottom of this puzzle section below. First, there's a memo on the side of the clock that says:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><i>The scars from the past shall<br />
                remove the nail that stops Time.</i></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The idea is to move the clock out of the way but you can't so you have to do 
              something. You'll need to find more clues. In the main section of this room, 
              there's a memo by the phone on a small wall table. The memo is different 
              depending on your riddle level:</p>
            <p><i>Easy</i></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><i>Three different sizes,<br />
                time on the run.<br />
                Three young men circlin'<br />
                round the sun.<br />
                Henry is short and<br />
                very, very slow,<br />
                Scott can't stop,<br />
                he's always on the go.</i></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The memo uses the names as the hands of the clock. So Henry would be the hour 
              hand on the clock since he's &quot;short and very, very slow&quot; and Scott is obviously 
              the second hand as &quot;he's always on the go.&quot;</p>
            <p><i>Normal/Hard/Extra</i></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><i>Three needles stand of<br />
                three different heights.<br />
                The fat, the tall and the thin.<br />
                From slow to fast they<br />
                move to the right.<br />
                Scott rests not on three,<br />
                but fifteen.</i></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The &quot;Three needles&quot; are easy to understand. They are simply the hands on the 
              clock. &quot;The fat, the tall and the thin&quot; - Hour, minute and second hands. &quot;From 
              slow to fast they move to the right&quot; describes the order of the hands: Hour, 
              Minute, Second.</p>
            <p>There's also another way to tell the names of the hands and this is how you're 
              sure who is the minute hand. Look at the first letter of each name:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>(H) Henry - (H) Hours<br />
                (M) Mildred - (M) Minutes<br />
                (S) Scott - (S) Seconds</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><img src="https://www.silenthillmemories.net/sh2/walkthrough/pics/sh2_p01_02.jpg" align="left" width="400" height="300" hspace="20" vspace="20"> </br>Go to the small room with the clock to find something written on the wall that 
              the clock is facing. The memo has three names and directions for each of them. 
              There's Henry and Scott from the other memo, and Mildred. Mildred would be the 
              minute hand since that's the last one left, and you determined that with the 
              first letters of each name and hand. The arrows for each name are as follows:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Henry: 9 (9 hours) - hour hand<br />
                Mildred: 2 (10 minutes) - minute hand<br />
                Scott: 3 (15 seconds) - second hand</p>

            <p>So that leaves you with <strong>9:10 and 15 seconds</strong>. But if you check the clock, you'll 
              notice that the second hand doesn't move and it's already on 15 seconds, so 
              don't worry about that one.</p>
            <p>You now have the solution so turn the clock hands to 9:10, and you should hear a 
              clank. That would be the &quot;nail that stops Time&quot;, from the memo, unlocking. You 
              can now push the clock and move on. No matter what Riddle Level you're playing, 
              the answer to this puzzle is always 9:10.</p></td>

  </br>
             <p>Now go to the right side of the clock and push 
              it, for a hole to be revealed. Go through the hole 
              to find yourself in Room 209. Enter the main section 
              of the room to find a <span class="save">Save Point</span> on a pushcart. Move into the kitchenette to find a <span class="curacion">Health Drink</span>. 
              Exit the room and go through the blue door, which is 
              the north stairwell. Go up the stairs and get the <span class="curacion">Handgun Bullets</span> placed on the ledge.</p>

			 </br> Go through the 3F door and go past a couple of doors 
              with broken locks, then enter Room 307 to see a 
              video of a pyramid-headed creature doing something 
              with two Mannequins. James hides in a closet and 
              fires at the monster when it comes close, which 
              causes it to leave the room. After the video, get 
              the <span class="objeto">Courtyard Key</span> in the closet where James was hiding. Exit the room 
              and head south past the Patient Demon to the end of 
              the hall. Then move west and get the <span class="objeto">Fire Escape Key</span> that the little girl kicked earlier.</p>
            <p>Enter the laundry room to the left and get the <span class="curacion">Handgun Bullets</span> on the floor. If you want some health and ammo, 
              enter Room 303. There is a Patient Demon in the 
              right room, but there are no items in there. Grab 
              the <span class="curacion">First-Aid Kit</span> on the left small cabinet in the main room. A pack 
              of <span class="curacion">Handgun 
              Bullets</span> is on the bed in a room to the left, 
              and a <span class="curacion">Health 
              Drink</span> is on the tipped over fridge in the 
              kitchenette. Exit the room when you're done and 
              enter the stairwell at the east end of the hall.</p>
            <p>Go down to 1F and go down the open hallway. At the 
              end, take the <span class="objeto">Canned 
              Juice</span> in front of Room 107. Go back and exit 
              through the double doors, unlocking them first. Run 
              west to the other double doors and go through them. 
              Go up to 2F and go in the laundry room beside the 
              stairway door. Go up to the garbage shoot and enter 
              your inventory see if you have any heavy items. The Canned Juice should do, so use it and the 
              garbage will be knocked down.</p>
            <p>Go back down to 1F and exit through the lobby doors. 
              Go to the bottom of the garbage shoot, which is 
              around the corner to the right. Take the <span class="objeto">Coin [Old Man]</span>. 
              There is also a memo in the garbage. Study the memo, 
              because later you will need to know something about 
              it. Go back through the lobby doors and go through 
              the courtyard door, using the Courtyard Key. Now is 
              a
              good time to equip the Handgun as there will be more 
              enemies here and in the near future than previously.</p>
            <p>Check your map and head for the pool. The pool has 
              no water in it so go to the edge and fall in. There 
              are three Patient Demons in here that may drain 
              you're health. Kill the Patient Demons with the 
              Handgun if you must, and go up to the baby carriage 
              to find the <span class="objeto">&nbsp;Coin 
              [Snake]</span>.</p>
            <p>

			Once you have the coin, use the northwest steps to 
              get out of the pool. Now enter the east door in the 
              courtyard (not the door you came through, the other 
              one). Move to the right, killing or moving past the 
              two Patient Demons, and enter Room 101. You should 
              hear someone vomiting, but check out the area first. 
              You can find a bloody open fridge with some legs 
              coming out of it in the kitchenette, and a pack of <span class="curacion">Handgun Bullets</span> in the far right corner of the room. Enter the 
              washroom, where the noise is coming from, and a video will play. James now meets 
              Eddie. Although no key items are procured here, you 
              must see Eddie or else you cannot continue further 
              into the game later.</p>
            <p>Exit the room after the video and if you want ammo, 
              enter Room 104. Kill the Patient Demon in the room 
              and grab the <span class="objeto"> Handgun Bullets</span> on the chair. Head back to 
              the door and note the tourist pamphlet on the desk. 
              Exit the room and head back to the main section of 
              2F. There are two ways: Up the stairwell right here 
              and pass through Room 209 and 208, or head outside 
              and through the other door and go up to 2F there. 
              There's one last open room in Wood Side and it's 
              Room 210. Go there if you want ammo.</p>
            <p>If you enter Room 210, kill the Patient Demon in the 
              main section of the room and take the <span class="curacion">Handgun Bullets</span> on the small table. In right room you can find more <span class="curacion">Handgun Bullets</span> on the corner table. Exit the room and head back 
              west all the way to the end of the hall and go 
              through the door, using the Fire Escape Key. There 
              is a window that leads to another apartment 
              replacing the fire escape, so move on, leaving Wood 
              Side.</p>
